I am attempting these puzzles with javascript. I just want to solve the puzzle, I doubt any of these solutions will be very elegant.

Solutions are printed to the console.

Example usage: `node puzzles/1/a.js`;

For part two of the puzzle, copy the files from the `a` directory to the `b` directory.
